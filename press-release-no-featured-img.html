<p>In addition to serving as vice president, McCurry will fill the role of president and CEO of the UT Foundation, Inc., which is the University’s interdependent, not-for-profit fundraising arm.</p>
 
<p>“The University of Tennessee has a history of strong alumni and donor engagement, and the benefits of those relationships are evident on every campus,” DiPietro said. “But as we look to the future and what we hope to achieve given our current challenges, it’s clear that we have to ask more from those who attribute their success to our University. This position is essential to helping us do that, and I’m confident we’ve selected the right leader.”</p>
 
<p>The vice president for development and alumni affairs and programs and UT Foundation president and CEO is the University’s chief development officer and has responsibility for providing leadership, planning, coordination and management of development and alumni affairs programs for the entire multi-campus University system.</p>
 
<p>“I am honored to have this opportunity to join the University of Tennessee System and the UT Foundation.  I look forward to working with President DiPietro, the foundation board, the UT alumni association, the chancellors and the alumni and development staff across the state to develop the relationships and secure the financial resources necessary to fulfill the strategic vision for the UT System and its various components. My family joins me in our excitement to return to east Tennessee,” McCurry said.</p>

<p>As vice president for institutional advancement for Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology since 2011, McCurry has been responsible for the overall administration and management of alumni relations, constituent relations, fundraising and special events programs.</p>  
 
<p>From 2000 to 2011, he was vice chancellor for institutional advancement at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, and chief executive officer of the Southern Illinois University Foundation. Among his various responsibilities was oversight for all Alumni Association activities.</p>
 
<p>From 1993 to 2000, McCurry was associate vice chancellor for development and alumni affairs at UT Knoxville. During that time, he served for three years as campaign director for the 21st Century Campaign. He also served as acting vice chancellor for development and alumni affairs from 1997 to 1998 and, in that role, was responsible for the overall leadership, management and administration of the development, alumni affairs and communications programs.</p>
 
<p>His 30-year career also includes senior-level development, alumni relations and advancement positions at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Pennsylvania State University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee.</p>  
 
<p>McCurry earned a bachelor’s degree in history from Lane College and a law degree from North Carolina Central University.</p>
 
<p>Lofton Stuart has been serving as interim UT vice president for development and alumni affairs and programs and president of the UT Foundation since September 2013 when the position was vacated. Stuart, previously UT Foundation vice president and executive director of the national UT Alumni Association, will remain with the Foundation through the end of 2015 to help in the transition.</p>
 
<p>The search to fill the vice president position has been underway since September 2014. More information is available at <a href="http://www.tennessee.edu/execsearch/development/">http://www.tennessee.edu/execsearch/development/</a>.
